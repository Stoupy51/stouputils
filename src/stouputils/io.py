This module provides utilities for file management.
- clean_path: Clean the path by replacing backslashes with forward slashes and simplifying the path
- super_open: Open a file with the given mode, creating the directory if it doesn't exist (only if writing)
- super_copy: Copy a file (or a folder) from the source to the destination (always create the directory)
- super_json_load: Load a JSON file from the given path
- super_json_dump: Writes the provided data to a JSON file with a specified indentation depth.
